When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I want to share or cooperate my work with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can focus on my work without being confused by remote changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork will create a repository on github based on the source of folk. Clone will
create a copy of repository on local machine based on the source of clone. And
branch will create a commit based on origin commit history.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It helps us to remote and local commit

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Without Git or Github, we can only cooperate with others through oral communication.
We can work independently and spend a lot of time to merge our work. So that git or
github is easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When I want to do some experimental development and don't want to affect the master
branch, I will create a separate branch and work on it. It helps me to keep track
on the master branch at the same time of doing my own job.
