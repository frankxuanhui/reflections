How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

If bug such as typo exists, we can find it from the difference part of two versions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

We can review and revert to the old versions of a file easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Automatically saving could prevent us from lose any information of the file.But mannualy
choosing when to create a commit could help us to have a more clear version tree,which are
seperated logically.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because in many times a certain function or component is composed of multiple files,
treat them as a group is more useful to represent a logical change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

use "git log" to show the history of files
use "git diff" plus commitID of two commits to show their difference

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I can checkout a previous commit at any time so that I'm not afraid of making wrong
changes which could break something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git as my version control tool to build up new program and find the
difference between git and svn.
